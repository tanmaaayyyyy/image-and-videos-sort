# image-and-videos-sort
I has a ton of images and videos in my hard drive and was trying to sort them manually but it was taking too long and when tried looking up online, i was not able to find any sources that would help me automate this process so i decided to make one by myself.

The file uploaded has a code to my work.

The sorter can sort the images and videos by the date when it was clicked. 
The program, when executed, opens up a window which let's you choose the directory where the images and videos are stored.
You can choose to either move or copy the files for sorting.
Once you start, the program will start sorting the images and videos according to the date and keeps making separate folders for each month and stores files in them.

The supported extensions are:
Images: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp
Videos: .mp4, .mov, .avi, .mkv, .3gp
